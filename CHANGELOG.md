# Changelog

All notable changes to Liaison RM are recorded here. The format follows Keep a Changelog principles and the project uses semantic versioning after the first tagged release.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Repository governance, contribution, knowledge, content-quality, architecture, and user-experience review standards.
- Pull-request evidence requirements and repository policy checks.
- Product, domain, security, platform, sharing, provider-neutral connection, and release specifications.
- Machine-readable requirements, persona UAT cases, feature gates, and implementation tasks.
- Interactive desktop and mobile concept with six committed review screens and browser-level interaction and accessibility smoke tests.
- Rust Workspace and People bounded contexts, typed shared identifiers and revisions, a Markdown/YAML vault adapter, and a local `liaison` CLI vertical slice.
- Cross-platform Rust formatting, checking, Clippy, domain, adapter, CLI, architecture, repository, and specification tests.
- Identity and Profiles domain types for Topic Packs, explicit information states, sealed sensitive values, Purpose Definitions, and purpose-specific readiness.
- Review and Attention reason-only policies, hard suppressions, explainable queue items, and capacity-bounded queue construction.

### Changed

- The repository README defines Liaison RM as a local-authoritative, open-file relationship manager.
- Review queues preserve factual reasons and do not expose a relationship-strength score.

### Security

- Documented the prohibition on undeclared network requests, hidden telemetry, secret material in canonical files, and provider or plugin access without an explicit grant.
- Defined separate Airgap and Connected-local build profiles and least-disclosure handling for sensitive relationship and workplace data.
- Kept network, provider, SQL, Tauri, and secret-storage dependencies out of the initial Workspace and People domain crates.
- Sensitive and secret profile definitions require sealed values in the new domain contract.
